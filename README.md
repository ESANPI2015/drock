# DROCK models

This library derives from the generic concepts formulated in the hypergraph and domaingraph libraries
and is related to the hardware components and architecture of (robotic) systems
as well as the software components (tasks) and networks thereof running on them.

## Example

For example, the processing hardware of a robot can be described by the means of

* Devices
  - Processors
* Interfaces
* Busses

These entities have the following general relations defined:

* Devices have Interfaces
* Busses connect Interfaces

With these concepts both processing devices, there interfaces and their interconnection can be described.
