# DROCK models

This library derives from the generic concepts formulated in the hypergraph and domaingraph libraries
and is related to the hardware components and architecture of (robotic) systems
as well as the software components (tasks) and networks thereof running on them.

The models presented here have been developed during the DROCK project at DFKI.
They are domain specific but embedded into higher level meta models such
that interdomain relations can be defined.
